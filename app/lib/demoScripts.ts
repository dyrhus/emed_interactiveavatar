Our program is fast, easy, and costs a fraction of what it would if you ran it through a normal health care benefit plan.

Let me show you how quick the onboarding process is. First, employees complete a short health questionnaire. Then, they schedule a video visit with one of our licensed healthcare professionals who will review their information and determine if they're eligible for the program.

That's it. Once approved, eMed tracks adherence to ensure the program is effective and to avoid waste and abuse. Here's an example of the weekly check-in process: Employees simply log their weight, any side effects, and confirm they're taking their medication as prescribed. This helps us ensure the program is working effectively for each participant.`;
